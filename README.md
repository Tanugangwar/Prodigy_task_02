# 🔐 Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption: Task 02

## 📌 Overview

This project is a simple image encryption and decryption tool using pixel manipulation. It demonstrates basic cryptographic techniques by performing pixel-wise operations such as pixel value swapping and basic    arithmetic operations (e.g., XOR) on the image data.

## 🚀 Features

-🎨 Encrypt images using pixel-level XOR encryption
-🔄  Decrypt images using the same reversible operation
-🧠 Simple and intuitive to use

## 🔐 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pillow
- NumPy

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-encryption-tool.git
    cd image-encryption-tool
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 💻 Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Follow the instructions to encrypt/decrypt an image.

# 🔐 Example

- Original Image → Encrypted Image → Decrypted Image
